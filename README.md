# expense-manager
Expense Manager has been created to demonstrate the ease of building a whole new business application using Liferay, once you start working with service builder you will notice the following.

Liferay provide a standard approach to facilitate the following platform services:
Search
Permissions
Persistence Layer “DB Layer” 

Liferay will allow you to focus on what matters, building your business logic only, while it will take care of the security, search, and DB.

Liferay will empower your application with a web service layer, which can be invoked from any external / internal application or system.

Liferay will allow your developer to use the preferred language / development framework to build the UI, in this example my preferred is Angular, however you can easily change it to JSP, React, VueJS, MetalJS or even pure plain java script, 

Once you finish building your UI a powerful provided gradle service will convert your UI into Liferay Native Widget, which you will be able to use it as part of the page builder toolbox, so you can easily drag and drop the widget in any page, this will empower you to implement micro front end easily. 

Build your own configuration portlet with a simple step which will allow you to control your whole application from one window; in my example, I have implemented DB translation module and integrated it with my application view, you will be able to configure the translations for any language from the configuration portlet, moreover I have added some lookup configuration, so it becomes handy to manage the Expense Item Types.
